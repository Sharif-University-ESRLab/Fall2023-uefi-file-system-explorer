# UEFI File System Explorer

In this project, we were responsible for developing a UEFI program functioning as a file system explorer. Our primary goal was to design a user interface that allows for easy navigation and interaction with files and directories in the UEFI environment. This project involved a detailed study of UEFI specifications and understanding the principles of developing related applications. Utilizing the protocols available in the UEFI file system, we integrated files and directories. Additionally, developing the user interface, adding advanced features like file searching, filtering, and sorting, and developing error management mechanisms to handle potential exceptions and errors were part of the challenges of this project. Finally, we conducted extensive testing and validation of the program in various scenarios.
